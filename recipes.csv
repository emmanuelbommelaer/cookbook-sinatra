Blackened Fish,"This blackened fish is cooked in a hot cast iron pan until charred and packed with flavor. This recipe calls for trout, but catfish or red snapper would be equally good. Be sure to have a well-ventilated kitchen!",4.6,15 mins
Mom's Best Peanut Brittle,"Sweet and salty peanut brittle with the perfect candy crunch is a wonderful gift for the holidays. This peanut brittle recipe is easy to make and wows everyone, every time.

We also recommend a good candy thermometer.",4.7,10 mins
